## 🌟 Importance of Claude Code

**Claude Code has become a rising star in the programming world**. This CLI tool launched by Anthropic is completely changing how programmers code:

- 🎯 **Vibe Coder's choice** — AI-assisted programming through command line becomes new trend
- ⚡ **Brand new programming experience** — Not just Claude model's power, CLI approach makes coding more intuitive and efficient
- 🔥 **Developer favorite** — From code generation to problem solving, Claude Code is reshaping development workflows

**However, Anthropic's strict access control is the biggest obstacle**:

As we all know, Anthropic implements strict access restrictions for Chinese users, preventing many developers from experiencing this revolutionary tool. Under modern control mechanisms, stable Claude Code usage faces core challenges:

1. **IP Detection** — Using "dirty" IPs, VPN IPs, or data center IPs are easily identified and blocked
2. **Behavior Patterns** — Frequent IP changes, machine-like request patterns easily trigger controls
3. **Device Fingerprints** — Request characteristics don't match real user behavior

**This tool focuses on solving these technical challenges**, allowing you to:
- ✅ Use clean residential IP addresses, avoid VPN detection
- ✅ Maintain 24-hour fixed IP, establish stable usage patterns
- ✅ Simulate real browser fingerprints, pass behavior detection
- ✅ Multiple users share same proxy, reduce usage costs

> 💡 **Complete Solution**: This tool solves IP and fingerprint issues. For payment issues, please refer to the payment solution description below.

## 🤔 Technical Details: Why Don't Regular Solutions Work?

If you encounter the following issues when using Claude Code:

- **Network restrictions** — Certain regions cannot directly access Claude Code
- **IP limitations** — Data center IPs or frequently changing proxy IPs are easily identified and restricted
- **Unstable connections** — Network fluctuations cause Claude Code call failures
- **Control issues** — Frequent IP changes trigger security detection

This project solves these problems through "**local proxy + fixed residential IP**" approach:

- 🚀 **Stable access**: Use real residential IP, avoid data center IP restrictions
- 🛡️ **Low risk**: 24-hour fixed IP, avoid frequent switching triggering controls
- 🔒 **Privacy security**: Proxy runs locally, data doesn't go through third parties
- 🤖 **Zero configuration**: Set environment variables, no need to modify existing code

- **Simplified configuration loading** - Unified configuration format, removed compatibility code, improved maintainability
- **Improved error handling** - Unhandled Promise rejections now trigger graceful shutdown
- **Refactored middleware** - Authentication and session management separated into independent middleware, clearer responsibilities

#### 📌 Comprehensive Security Hardening
- **DNS leak protection** - All network requests (including health checks) now go through proxy, prevent real IP exposure
- **Dynamic TLS fingerprints** - Implemented 5 browser TLS configuration pools, random selection per session, avoid fingerprint recognition
- **Browser consistency** - User-Agent, Client Hints, Accept headers completely matched, eliminate fingerprint conflicts
- **Background noise traffic** - Added NoiseManager, generates random website visits, avoid single API traffic patterns

#### 📌 Advanced Feature Implementation
- **18-30 hour random sessions** - Session duration randomization, closer to real user behavior
- **Human behavior simulation** - Added BehaviorManager, implements ACTIVE/THINKING/IDLE state machine
- **Geographic location matching** - Added GeoMatcher, automatically matches proxy location language and timezone
- **Tiered health checks** - Lightweight checks separated from heavyweight checks, reduce unnecessary API calls

#### 📌 Testing and Stability
- **Complete test suite** - Added unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, 95%+ coverage
- **Circuit breaker mechanism** - Automatic cooldown when all proxies fail, avoid resource exhaustion
- **Log desensitization** - Automatically hide sensitive information like IPs, passwords
- **Configuration validation** - Automatic configuration integrity validation at startup

#### 📌 User Experience Optimization
- **macOS app support** - Provide native .app package, double-click to start
- **Configuration externalization** - Browser fingerprints, TLS configuration moved to `config/fingerprints.json`
- **Detailed documentation** - Added architecture docs, test reports, optimization guides, etc.
